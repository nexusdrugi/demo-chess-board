1. User views the chess board in starting position
2. User clicks on a piece (only pieces of current turn color are selectable)
3. System highlights the selected piece and shows all valid move squares
4. User either clicks on a valid destination square or drags the piece to it
5. System validates the move, updates board position, and switches turns
6. Process repeats until game completion or reset
