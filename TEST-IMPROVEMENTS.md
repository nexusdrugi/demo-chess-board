# Test Suite Improvement Report

This document reviews the current tests, evaluates their value, proposes targeted improvements, and lists missing tests that would increase confidence and coverage. A trackable task list appears at the end.

## Current State Overview

- Engine and Utilities: strong coverage for movement, legality filtering, check detection, endgame detection, castling, and en passant legality.
- State management (useChessGame hook): strong for undo/redo, castling rights updates, and en passant execution, including undo/redo and SAN for e.p.
- Notation (SAN): broad coverage including castling (O-O/O-O-O), disambiguation, captures, promotion (default/explicit and with capture), and check/checkmate suffixes.
- UI components: tests in place for GameControls (status, actions, history), ConfirmationDialog (confirm/cancel/Esc, focus), ChessSquare/ChessPiece DnD (valid/invalid payloads), ErrorBoundary (fallback + reset), and ChessBoard (labels and highlights).
- Minor hygiene: a few legacy assertions compare tuple positions against string squares; replace with square-string checks. Many have been updated; continue to prefer square-string checks.

## Suite-by-Suite Review and Improvements

### 1) utils/moveValidation tests

- Value today
  - Good breadth: piece move generation (rook/knight/bishop/queen/king/pawn), getValidMoves legality filtering, isKingInCheck, hasAnyLegalMoves, isCheckmate/isStalemate.
  - Castling validation tests plus en passant move-generation inclusion are present.

- Improvements
  - Replace legacy negative castling assertions like `not.toContainEqual(pos(7, 6))` with string squares: `'g1'` (and `'c1'` for queen-side). Move arrays are string squares.
  - Pinned piece legality: add tests ensuring pinned pieces cannot move to expose own king; only moves that maintain block (or capture along pin line) are allowed.
  - King safety: ensure king cannot move into attacked squares (explicit via getValidMoves for king). Add symmetry for both colors.
  - Castling refinements:
    - Symmetry for black (g8/c8) in all positive/negative scenarios.
    - Positive: rook may be attacked; only the king’s current, pass-through, and destination squares must be safe. Add a test case to prove this.
  - En passant edge cases:
    - e.p. must not be allowed if it leaves own king in check (isMoveLegal filters it).
    - e.p. eligibility expires after one opponent ply if not used.
    - hasAnyLegalMoves with e.p. as the only legal move returns true.

- Example test ideas

```ts path=null start=null
// Pinned bishop cannot move off the pin line (any move would expose king on same file)
it('forbids pinned bishop moves that expose king to check', () => {
  // e-file: White king e1, white bishop e2, black rook e8
  const board = createCustomBoard([
    { position: pos(7, 4), piece: createPiece('king', 'white') },
    { position: pos(6, 4), piece: createPiece('bishop', 'white') },
    { position: pos(0, 4), piece: createPiece('rook', 'black') },
  ]);
  const moves = getValidMoves(board, getSquareFromCoordinates(6, 4), 'white'); // bishop e2
  expect(moves).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

```ts path=null start=null
// En passant expires after one move if not used
it('expires en passant target after one ply when not used', () => {
  // Setup: black just played d7->d5 (enPassantTarget = 'd6'), white plays a non-e.p. move (e2->e3),
  // then white pawn on e5 no longer has 'd6' as a move.
});
```

```ts path=null start=null
// Rook under attack does NOT invalidate castling if king path is safe
it('allows castling when rook is attacked but king path and landing are safe', () => {
  // White pieces: king e1, rook h1; Black attacker covering h1 but not e1/f1/g1; rights allow.
  // Assert: getKingMoves includes 'g1'.
});
```

### 2) hooks/useChessGame tests

- Value today
  - Strong: verifies undo/redo, captured piece restoration (hasMoved flags), castling rights toggle/restore, captured-corner rook disables opponent rights, en passant execution with removal from correct square and SAN, and redo.

- Improvements
  - Castling execution via the hook:
    - Legal king-side and queen-side castling (white and black) moves; verify rook auto-movement, both pieces’ hasMoved flags set, and SAN is `O-O` / `O-O-O`.
    - Undo/redo: restore both king and rook; rights restored from prevCastlingRights.
  - En passant lifecycle in state:
    - enPassantTarget is set on double pawn advance and cleared after subsequent move if not used.
  - Redo policy:
    - Redo history is cleared when a new move is made after undo (already expected; add explicit test).
  - SAN formatting:
    - Check (`+`) and checkmate (`#`) on moves that deliver these states.

- Example test ideas

```ts path=null start=null
// Castling through the hook (execution + SAN + undo/redo)
test('executes O-O with correct rook move and SAN, supports undo/redo', () => {
  // Arrange: clear path for white, rights set true, king not in/through/into check
  // Act: move e1 -> g1
  // Assert: h1 rook -> f1, moveHistory.last.notation === 'O-O'
  // Undo/redo: verify both pieces restored/moved correctly and rights roll back/forward
});
```

```ts path=null start=null
// Redo cleared after new move
test('clears redo history after a new move is made following undo', () => {
  // Arrange: make two moves; undo once; make a different new move
  // Assert: redoHistory is empty
});
```

### 3) utils/chessUtils tests

- Value today
  - Good: initial rights, `isKingMove`/`isRookMove`, king move disabling both sides, rook move disabling side, capturing rook on corners disables opponent side.

- Improvements
  - Immutability: assert `updateCastlingRightsForMove` does not mutate the input rights object.
  - Non-corner scenarios: moving/capturing rooks not on a1/h1/a8/h8 should not change rights.
  - Already-moved rook: moving it again shouldn’t (re)toggle rights; capture corner rook when rights already false remains false.

- Example test ideas

```ts path=null start=null
it('does not mutate input castling rights', () => {
  const rights = createInitialCastlingRights();
  const piece = { type: 'king', color: 'white', hasMoved: false } as const;
  const next = updateCastlingRightsForMove(rights, piece, 'e1','e2');
  expect(rights.white.kingSide).toBe(true);
  expect(next.white.kingSide).toBe(false);
});
```

### 4) utils/notation tests

- Value today
  - Solid start for promotion (default/explicit) and en passant `e.p.` suffix.

- Improvements
  - Castling SAN: `O-O` and `O-O-O`.
  - Disambiguation: when two identical pieces can move to the same square, assert correct file/rank/both disambiguators.
  - Check/checkmate suffix: `+` and `#`.
  - Pawn capture notation: `exd5`.
  - Promotion with capture: e.g., `exd8=Q`, with `+`/`#` when applicable.

- Example test ideas

```ts path=null start=null
it('adds disambiguation by file when two knights can reach the same square', () => {
  // Two white knights on b1 and d1 both can go to c3; moving b1->c3 should format as Nbc3
});
```

## UI Tests: Current Coverage

- ChessBoard
  - Renders 8×8 squares with rank/file labels.
  - Highlights selected square and valid moves according to gameState.
- ChessSquare + ChessPiece
  - Drag-and-drop: ChessPiece sets dataTransfer with its square; ChessSquare triggers onPieceDrop only when valid (format and from ≠ to); invalid drag payloads are safely ignored.
- GameControls
  - Displays current player and game status (active/check/checkmate/stalemate) correctly.
  - Undo/Redo buttons enable/disable correctly and invoke handlers.
  - Move history renders SAN and from→to info.
  - Reset opens ConfirmationDialog; confirm calls onResetGame; cancel closes the dialog.
- ConfirmationDialog
  - Confirm/cancel callbacks; Esc to close; focus behavior is sane; no global Enter confirmation.
- ErrorBoundary
  - Renders fallback UI when child throws; Reset calls onReset; recovers after reset.

## Hygiene & Policy Improvements

- Clean assertions
  - Replace any remaining tuple-vs-string mismatches (`pos(...)` vs `'g1'`) with square-string checks.
- Helper extraction
  - Consolidate repetitive board setup code into shared helpers for readability and consistency.
- Coverage thresholds
  - Add coverage gates in `vitest.config.ts` (e.g., statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 70%) to catch regressions.
- Coverage service
  - Integrate Codecov (or Coveralls) to annotate PRs, fail on coverage drops, and add a README badge.
- Local hooks
  - Add a Husky pre-commit hook to run lint and a quick `vitest --run` subset to catch errors early.

## Suggested Prioritized Plan

1) Legibility & quick wins
   - Replace legacy castling assertions to use square strings.
   - Add 3–5 engine tests: pinned piece, king safety, black castling symmetry, rook-under-attack castling legal, e.p. self-check prevention.
2) Notation coverage
   - Add castling SAN, disambiguation, check/checkmate suffix, pawn capture, promotion with capture.
3) Hook scenarios
   - Castling execution + SAN + undo/redo; redo-cleared-after-new-move; e.p. expiry lifecycle.
4) UI coverage
   - Add 2–3 RTL-based interaction tests (GameControls + ConfirmationDialog; drag-and-drop happy path & invalid path).
5) Quality gates
   - Add coverage thresholds; optionally integrate Codecov + badge.
